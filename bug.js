This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is a common issue in React Native applications that use asynchronous operations to update state variables, such as fetching data from an API or interacting with a database.  When the component renders before these operations are complete, the state variable will be undefined, resulting in the error.

```javascript
// Incorrect code
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
